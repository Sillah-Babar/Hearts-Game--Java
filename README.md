# Heart Card Game Rules

***

Hearts is a trick taking game that requires 4 players and a standard 52 playing card deck with Aces high and 2’s low. The objective of the game is to have the fewest points when someone reaches 100 points.

## Set Up

***

Before game play can begin, a dealer must be selected. Each player draws one card from a shuffled deck. The player with the lowest card becomes the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out 13 cards clockwise to each player.

## How to Play

***

The player with the 2 of Clubs always makes the first lead starting with that card. Moving to the left of the 2 of Clubs, players must follow suit and try to out rank the cards in play. If they cannot follow suit, then any card may be played with the lead suit trumping others. If, on the first trick, a player does not have any Clubs to match the 2, they neither can play any Hearts nor the Queen of Spades. The winner of the trick goes first in the next round.

## Scoring

***

When all cards are played, players examine their tricks won and count the Hearts and the Queen of Spades. Hearts are worth 1 point each and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points. Players want to avoid wining tricks with Hearts and the Queen of Spades as much as possible. If, however, a player wins all of the Hearts and the Queen of Spades in the game, the player “Shoots the Moon” and receives no points while all other players receive 26 points.
